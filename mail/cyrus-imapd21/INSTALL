Please also refer to:

	${PKG_PREFIX}/share/doc/html/cyrus-imapd/install.html

for more detailed instructions on setting up the environment before
starting the Cyrus IMAP server.  In particular, several services will
probably need to be added to /etc/services.

Note anyone upgrading from an earlier version of cyrus should read:

	${PKG_PREFIX}/share/doc/html/cyrus-imapd/install-upgrade.html

Also note that cyrus-imapd now uses saslauthd rather then pwcheck by
default.
