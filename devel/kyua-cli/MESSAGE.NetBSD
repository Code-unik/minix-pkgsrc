$NetBSD$

You are encouraged to run the NetBSD system-wide test suite that lives in
/usr/tests with Kyua (and report any regressions that you encounter).

To do so, you will first need to generate new Kyuafiles into the test suite
tree because Kyua does not use Atffiles and the NetBSD build system does
not yet install Kyuafiles.  The process is automated and is described in:
