# The mremap function is not covered by POSIX, so operating systems are
# free to define the function as they want:
#
# NetBSD: void *mremap(void *oldp, size_t oldsize,
#			void *newp, size_t newsize, int flags);
# Linux: void *mremap(void *old_address, size_t old_size,
#			size_t new_size, unsigned long flags);
